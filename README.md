# Gatsby Blog Converted from CRA

This is a personal blog built with gatsby. Since the React App built with CRA deployed on github pages is not SEO friendly ( Using pre-render or SSR is better ). I switch to the gatsby and reuse most of code in the CRA App.

## Original CRA React App

The original React App built with CRA could be found [here](https://github.com/yirueilu-b/YirueiLuBlog/tree/gh-pages). Most of them are the same. Switching from CRA to Gatsby just needs to convert the routes part in the code to the directory structure that Gatsby defined.

## Usage
- Clone this REPO.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `npm install`
- `npm run develop` to see pages locally.
- Use `bash git_push.sh` to update on develop branch.
- `npm run deploy` to publish new page.
