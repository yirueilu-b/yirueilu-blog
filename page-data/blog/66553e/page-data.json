It's a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. This post is for taking a note of how to use it with React App and Github page.\n\n## Install Utterances\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rpGDKAu.png)\n\nInstalling Utterances is super simple, just need few clicks and everything is done.\n\n- Install the Utterances Github App to let the Utterances bot access your repository.\n\n    [Install Utterances Github App here](https://github.com/apps/utterances)\n\n- After Installing the App, get the Utterances scripts which should be included in the page later.\n\n    [Check this page for auto generated script settings](https://utteranc.es/)\n\nUtterances is ready to go now.\n\n## Add Utterances in a React App\n\n- Load the Utterances script in a component within `componentDidMount`\n\n```\ncomponentDidMount() {\n        let script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n        let anchor = document.getElementById(\"inject-comments-for-uterances\");\n        script.setAttribute(\"src\", \"https://utteranc.es/client.js\");\n        script.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\", \"anonymous\");\n        script.setAttribute(\"async\", true);\n        script.setAttribute(\"repo\", [USER_NAME/REPO_NAME]);\n        script.setAttribute(\"issue-term\", [UNIQUE_ID]);\n        script.setAttribute(\"theme\", [THEME]);\n        anchor.appendChild(script);\n}\n```\n\nI use `creat-react-app` to build the blog and use the `hash-router` in `react-router-dom` so there could be some issue when loading the comment widget.\n\nThe parameters after `#` would be ignored and Utterances bot will reference `url` or `path` to the root/base URL and all posts will load the same comments.\n\nTherefore, at the `issue-term` attribute, we must provide an unique ID of the post `UNIQUE_ID` so that the Utterances bot could reference to each posts and create issue independently.\n\n- After loading the scripts, the comments are now ready to be rendered as below.\n\n```\n<div id=\"inject-comments-for-uterances\">\n</div>\n```\n\nNow the comment widget should have shown on the page and everything is done.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BEwSuJh.png)\n\n## Reference\n\n[example for react use #161](https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/161)\n\n[2 Pages have same comments #119](https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/119)\n\n###### tags: `Web`"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
